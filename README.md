# HeborisUE-OSX

This is a project for running HeborisUE on OSX 10.11.

What works:
- SDL version of HeborisUE

What doesn't work:
- OpenGL version of HeborisUE

The existing binaries of HeborisUE were compatible for Lion and didn't seem to be working for OSX 10.11 (El Capitan).  

Changes were built off of the source code here (Heboris Collection): https://tetris.wiki/Heboris.  I updated the SDL libs from SDL 1.2 to SDL 2.0.
