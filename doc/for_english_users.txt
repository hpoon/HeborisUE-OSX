4. 8 Selectable Rules
----------------------------------------------------
You can select 8 different rotation rules.

HEBORIS     : TGM1 and TGM2 style. Same as original heboris rotation.
TI-ARS      : TGM3 style. T and I piece have special ground kick(It works only once!).
TI-WORLD    : SRS, you can move 10 times, or rotate 8 times.
ACE-SRS     : SRS, you can move 128 times, or rotate 128 times 
              Fast drop is slower than TI-WORLD.
ACE-ARS     : TGM-ACE style rotation rule. Really strange! 
              Fast drop is slower than TI-ARS.
ACE-ARS2    : Same as ACE-ARS, except soft drop and hard drop. 
              Fast drop is slower than TI-ARS.
DS-WORLD    : SRS, you can rotate or move infinity! 
              Fast drop is slower than TI-WORLD.
SRS-X       : Original rotation rule based on SRS. But you can use Zangi-moves!
               You can move 24 times, or rotate 12 times.
               And C-botton is "180 degree rotarion" with original wall kicks. 
D.R.S       : If you have ever played DTET,let's use this!
               Added T and I ground kick(only once!) to it.
